# ðŸ¥˜ ShelfChef

ShelfChef is a recipe-finding web app that helps you cook with what you already have in your kitchen.  
Enter your available ingredients, and ShelfChef will suggest recipes by integrating with the Spoonacular API.  

It also supports saving your own recipes locally, caching API results for faster performance, and managing your personal recipe collection.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: API rate limit exceeded**
- The free Spoonacular API has a limit of 150 requests/day
- The app caches results to minimize API calls

**Issue: Database not found**
- Run `python create_db.py` to initialize the database

**Issue: Module not found errors**
- Ensure you're in the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
